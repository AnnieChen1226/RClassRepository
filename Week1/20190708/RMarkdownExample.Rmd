## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

example 4 pieChart1

```{r pie}
expenditure <- c("Housing"=600, "Food"=300,"Cloths"=150,"Entrtainment"=100,"Other "=200)
expenditure
pie(expenditure)
```

example 4 pieChart2

```{r pie2}
pie(expenditure,
    labels=as.character(expenditure),
    main="MonthlyExpenditureBreakdown",
    col=c("red","orange","yellow","blue","green"),
    border="brown",clockwise=TRUE)
```

example 4 barChart1

```{r barChart1}
max.temp <- c(22, 27, 26, 24, 23, 26, 28)
barplot(max.temp)
```

example 4 barChart2

```{r barChart2, echo=TRUE}
# barchart with added parameters
barplot(max.temp,
main = "Maximum Temperatures in a Week",
xlab = "Degree Celsius",
ylab = "Day",
names.arg = c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"),
col = "darkred",
horiz = TRUE)
```
